To run the source code, Python 3.8 or newer and pip must be installed. Then, you can clone the repository or download it as a zip file and extract it. Navigate to the root folder of the repository in Command Prompt or Terminal. Then, after creating a virtual environment (or you can just use regular pip), run the command `pip3 install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt`, or if that doesn't work, `pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt`. Then, run the command `python3 -m tic-tac-toe` or `python -m tic-tac-toe`.
